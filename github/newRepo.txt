this should be a markdown file.

cd into repo
git init
code README.md // create and edit README.md in Visual Studio Code
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repository-name>.git
git push -u origin main

when having trouble pushing, consider this: push -uf origin main

Even though force pushing is not the best idea, this is about an empty, new repository, so it should not lead to any troubles down the road with git history..
